<h1>The Golden Hammer</h1>
<h2>Flatiron School HiveMind Automation Tool</h2>

![](https://github.com/drumnation/the-golden-hammer/blob/master/the-golden-hammer-demo.gif)

<h4>Requires Watir and Chromedriver - The script should auto install their gems if you don't have them.</h4>

</p>!!! If they don't install on their own and there is an error, type these two commands into your console to install the required libraries.</p>

<blockquote>
    gem install watir<br />
    gem install chromedriver-helper
</blockquote>

<p>!!! When you copy the lesson name from github <strong>remove the "-031317" or other class prefix from the end of it</strong> before you paste it into The Golden Hammer. It should look like the example.</p>

<p>!!! For the file path, if the lesson file is in a folder you need to copy the formatting in the example and paste the "directory_name/lesson_file.rb" path</p>

<p>The gifted entrepreneur Steve Jobs made some
controversial comments about innovation during his career.
He expressed strong agreement with the following aphorism
which he ascribed to the famous painter <a
href="http://www.picasso.fr/us/picasso_page_index.php"
target="_blank">Pablo Picasso</a>:</p>

<p>I would happen to agree. With a <a
href="http://www.wcupa.edu/arts-humanities/music/musicTheory/undergraduate.aspx"
target="_blank">B.A. in Music Composition</a>, I learned all
about transforming any theme into something new. Doing this
requires many techniques for manipulating music in a
controlled manner, allowing you to achieve the exact
aesthetic you hear in your mind. A score is a program that
runs live humans in synchronization instead of a
computer.</p>

<p>I spent hours in the music library poring over orchestral
scores while listening to their recordings. It taught me to
connect what things sound like with what things look like on
the page. It also gave me the opportunity to collect a grab
bag of techniques that I liked a lot and could later use in
my own music.</p>

<p>The ultimate secret of master makers is that nobody is
original. The greatest artists copy as many of their idols
as they can because they absolutely love them and their
resulting products often become beautiful diverse blends of
others' fresh and original ideas, neatly curated by the
artist.</p>

<p>Every answer to a Flatiron question becomes a tool we
will use to make our future programs better so why not learn
ALL the answers? In the spirit of our recent reading
assignment '<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html"
target="_blank">Hackers and Painters</a>' I want to give
this tool to everybody so we can better learn from each
other.</p>

<p>When I'm stumped I fire up the Golden Hammer make a list
of the 5 most cleverly diverse solutions and try to
refactor them into an über answer.</p>

<p>I then take screenshots of my über answer and the
selected 5 and put them on the back of an <a
href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki
digital flashcard</a> (will also explain that on my blog
soon). I look up the docs for, and screenshot, any syntax or
terms used that I didn't understand.</p>

<p>I wrote this program while I was doing my pre-work and
decided to clean it up and make it easy for other people to
use. I updated it with this menu stuff at the end of my
first week.  I credit this to the smarts of the 0217 class
because I've been all over their answers and they have some
really smart people.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://www.wcupa.edu/arts-humanities/music/appliedMusic/cHanning.aspx"
target="_blank">percussion instructor</a> taught us to never
practice mistakes. Always slow the metronome down until you
can play it perfect or you're just teaching yourself to play
it wrong.  Without our community of ideas you could be
practicing the longest way to solve your problems exercise
after exercise and never know it.</p>

<p>The real truth is it's not stealing. It's just a much
more effective way to learn. Since it's such a pain in the
butt clicking so many links to get to the answers on GitHub,
not being sure if the answer you clicked is complete, I hope
this bot helps everyone learn more efficiently.</p>

<p>Feel free to steal this code and make your own bot! It
should have automatically installed <a href="http://watir.github.io/docs/home" target="_blank">Watir</a> the Ruby library
for the testing suite <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank">Selenium</a> as well as <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads" target="_blank">Chromedriver</a>.</p>

<p>Ask me for help anytime! Thanks guys! -Dave Mieloch</p>
